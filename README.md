# Python_Projects

So, this Repo is inhabited by projects I did when starting to program in Python language.
Eventually I'll be able to look back at this Repo and tell myself "Oh, you've improved so much"
I'm confident I'll do so. In the meantime, my most ambitious project yet is a command line notepad
that I'll use when playing online competitive games, to keep track of my opponent's behaviors in my
secondary screen. I'll also make an app that uses both the Twitter and the Twitch APIs to detect if
the user is streaming or not; if they are, then it sends a Twitter message to the user's followers
with their link attached.
